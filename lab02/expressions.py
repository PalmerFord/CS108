# 3 + 4 computes to 7 as expected

# 2 + 3 * 5 computes to 17 as expected following order of operations

# 8 - 4 - 2 computes to 2 as expected

# (3 + 7) * 2 computes to 20 as expected following order of operation

# 13 % 4 evaluates to 1 as expected

# 8.2 // 4 evaluates to 2.0 as expected given that 8.2 is a float

# 2**10 evaluates to 1024 as expected

# 5.1 % 2 evaluates to 1.0999999999999996 which is approximately what I expected
